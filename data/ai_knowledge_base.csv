Question,Answer
"What is Artificial Intelligence?","Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems."
"What is Machine Learning?","Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed."
"What is Deep Learning?","Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data."
"What is NLP?","NLP stands for Natural Language Processing, a field of AI that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language."
"What is a neural network?","A neural network is a series of algorithms that mimic the structure of the human brain to recognize patterns and solve tasks like image or speech recognition."
"What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?","LLMs are AI models trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like text, such as GPT-4."
"What is computer vision?","Computer Vision is an AI field that enables computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual input like images or videos."
"What's the difference between AI, ML, and Deep Learning?","AI is the broadest field; ML is a subset of AI; and Deep Learning is a further subset of ML using layered neural networks."
"What are real-world applications of AI?","AI is used in healthcare (diagnostics), finance (fraud detection), retail (recommendation engines), and many other industries."
"How is AI used in education?","AI powers personalized learning, automated grading, and adaptive tutoring systems in education."
"How is AI used in healthcare?","AI helps in early disease detection, drug discovery, and personalized treatment planning."
"What are ethical concerns in AI?","Ethical concerns include data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, accountability, and job displacement."
"What is bias in AI?","Bias in AI occurs when training data or algorithm design leads to unfair or discriminatory outcomes."
"How can we ensure ethical AI use?","Ethical AI requires transparency, fairness in data, regular audits, and clear accountability mechanisms."
"Where can I learn more about AI?","You can explore more through online courses like Courseraâ€™s AI for Everyone, or bootcamp modules covering ML, NLP, and ethics."
