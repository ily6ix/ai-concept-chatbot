Question,Answer
What is Artificial Intelligence?,"AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines, enabling them to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving."
What is Machine Learning?,Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
What is NLP?,"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that helps machines understand, interpret, and generate human language."
What is a Neural Network?,"A neural network is a computing system inspired by the human brain's structure, used to detect patterns and relationships in data."
What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?,"LLMs are AI models trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like text, like ChatGPT or BERT."
What is Computer Vision?,Computer Vision enables machines to interpret and process visual information like images and videos.
"What is the difference between AI, ML, and Deep Learning?",AI is the umbrella term. ML is a subset that enables learning from data. Deep Learning is a further subset that uses neural networks with many layers.
How is deep learning different from machine learning?,"Deep learning uses layered neural networks and requires large data sets, while traditional ML relies on structured data and simpler algorithms."
How is AI used in healthcare?,"AI helps in diagnostics, medical imaging, drug discovery, and personalizing treatment plans."
How is AI used in finance?,"AI powers fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and customer service bots."
What are AI use cases in education?,"AI helps in adaptive learning, automated grading, and intelligent tutoring systems."
What is ethical AI?,"Ethical AI ensures fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy in AI systems."
What are AI biases?,AI bias occurs when an AI system reflects or amplifies unfair prejudices from its training data.
How can AI bias be reduced?,"By using diverse training data, performing audits, and ensuring human oversight in decision-making."
